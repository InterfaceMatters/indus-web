## Development

In the project directory run: `yarn start`

## Build and deployment

`yarn build` -
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
##### The app is ready to be deployed!

##### The app uses firebase hosting and is already initialized with hosting.

`firebase serve --only hosting` - Serves the build folder in local.
`firebase deploy` - Deploys the app to firebase.
